# QUIP.jl
Julia PyCall wrapper of QUIPPY for Accessing SOAP Descriptor

This package includes a simple code that demonstrates how to access SOAP descriptor using PyCall and QUIPPY. 
Currently, it does not provide any other descriptor or features of QUIP and QUIPPY codes but new features would like to be added in future. 


## How to cite:

If you use this code and hence dependent codes [QUIPPY with QUIP](http://libatoms.github.io/QUIP/) and SOAP as it is part of [GAP](http://libatoms.github.io/GAP/) for your any academic paper or publication, you need to accept the license of [GAP suite â€” Non-commercial License Agreement](http://www.libatoms.org/gap/gap_download.html) and cite both the codes and their papers as they are described in the codes' [webpage](http://libatoms.github.io/QUIP/).
