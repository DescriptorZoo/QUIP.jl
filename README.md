# QUIP.jl
Julia PyCall wrapper of QUIPPY for Accessing SOAP Descriptor

This package includes a simple code that demonstrates how to access SOAP descriptor using PyCall and QUIPPY. 
Currently, it does not provide any other descriptor or features of QUIP and QUIPPY codes but new features would like to be added in future. 


## How to cite:

If you use this code and hence dependent codes [QUIPPY with QUIP](http://libatoms.github.io/QUIP/) and SOAP as part of [GAP](http://libatoms.github.io/GAP/), you need to acknowledge [their licenses and cite both the codes and their papers](http://www.libatoms.org/gap/gap_download.html) as they are described in the codes' [webpage](http://libatoms.github.io/QUIP/).
